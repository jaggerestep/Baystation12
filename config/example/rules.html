<h3>New Eden Server Rules</h3>

<p><b>1. Admins have the final say in all matters</b></p>
<p>Admins often deal with multiple cases at the same time, and work can be stressful. There is no spare time that we can use to argue with you. If you feel that you have been treated unfairly by an administrator, post a complaint in the complaint section of the forums, where the rest of the staff can review what occurred. Persistant arguing with administrators can and will result in verbal warnings, and eventually a ban. The progression of punishments is as follows:
<ol><li>Verbal warning</li>
<li> Verbal warning</li>
<li>Day ban</li>
</ol>
Subsequent offenses will result in a day ban, and may disqualify you from any positions that you apply to in the future.

<p><b>2. No Random Deathmatch (RDM)</b></p>
<p>Random Deathmatch is a broad term that admins can use to describe a multitude of scenarios. Some of the more common offenses that fall under RDM include, but are not limited to:
<ul><li>Murder without proper IC escalation</li>
<li>Welding individuals in a locker with no proper IC reason</li>
<li>Trapping individuals in rooms they cannot escape with no proper IC reason</li>
<li>Turning people into cyborgs without consent nor proper IC reason</li>
</ul>
This list is not all-encompassing, and common sense must be used when you are uncertain as to whether or not you are committing RDM. The progression of punishments for RDM is as follows:
<ol><li>Verbal warning</li>
<li>Day ban</li>
<li>Three day ban</li>
<li>Week ban</li>
</ol>
Subsequent offenses will be reviewed on a case by case basis, and may result in a permanent ban from the server.

<p><b>3. No Bombing</b></p>
<p>Bombing is a rather self-explanatory term, used to describe an explosion that inflicts damage to the station. Bombing can be carried out in many ways, and none of them are open to non-antagonists, unless you have received permission from an administrator beforehand. If you are unsure as to whether or not you should use a bomb, do not hesitate to PM an administrator and ask for clarification. Types of bombs that one may encounter on the station are:
<ul><li>Welder bombs</li>
<li>Tank transfer bombs</li>
<li>Grenades</li>
<li>Canister bombs</li>
</ul>
Bombing carries with it a serious punishment. It disrupts the station severely, and can ruin the round for many players. If you have purposefully bombed, punishments you can and will receive are as follows:
<ol><li>Verbal warning (If determined to be an accident)</li>
<li>Three day ban</li>
<li>Week ban</li>
</ol>
Subsequent offenses will most likely result in a permanent ban from the server. However, bombing is usually judged on a case by case basis, and an admin may decide to give you a permanent ban on your first offense if it is deemed to be particularily malicious. As always, admins will use their best judgment, and have the final say.

<p><b>4. No IC in OOC/OOC in IC</b></p>
<p>IC in OOC is defined as releasing IC information over OOC chat. This type of conduct can influence the game, and is highly frowned upon. OOC in IC is defined as using real life information in an IC context. Usually this is something silly, such as "Why do I have a blue R floating above my head?" or using netspeak. Players themselves will often chastise and discourage conduct like this, but in the case where a player continually breaks this rule, we do have punishments in place. These punishments are as follows:
<ol><li>Verbal warning</li>
<li>Verbal warning</li>
<li>Mute OR Kick OR Day ban</li>
<li>Antagonist ban (If revealing an antagonist)
</ol>
Subsequent offenses will result in a day ban. These punishments are subject to vary significantly, depending on the type of information that was relayed through OOC chat by the player. If the information involved revealing an antagonist, IC in OOC will carry a much harsher punishment, and possibly even an antagonist ban.

<p><b>5. Abysmal Roleplay</b></p>
Here at New Eden, we value roleplay just as much as we value the sillyness that has given SS13 it's traditional popularity. There is no clear-cut definition of abysmal RP, but we do have examples that will help give you an idea of what can get you banned. These are as follows:
<ul><li>Speaking faster than one can physically talk in real life AKA spamming. (And no, you aren't Eminem. You can't spit 13 words a second just because he can.)</li>
<ul><li>This rule does not mean you have to cap how fast you type, or how much. This rule is here to make sure paragraphs aren't copy-pasted into the radio multiple times in the span of a few seconds.</li>
</ul>
<li>Abusing the voice system. (Assuming voices are currently active on the server.)
<li>Not following any known naming convention, real or lore-based. Also, using names of famous individuals. (Ex. "Shitty McFags," "XxPr0scopeN0scope," "Adolf Hitler," "J.K. Rowling")</li>
<li>Acting mentally retarded, insane, or autistic, with no IC reason to do so. Examples of this include:
<ul><li>Using emotes such as "begins helicoptering his penis," "takes a shit on the floor and promptly eats it all," etc.
<li>Attacking multitudes of people with absolutely no provocation, nor the slightest IC reason.
</ul>
<li>Showing absolutely no IC emotion to any events. We don't expect you to *cry every time you see blood, but one of the most annoying things someone can do is be handcuffed to a chair about to be tortured, only to say "lol its a game kill me idc." Don't do that.
</ul>
Punishments for not following this simple etiquette stack up as follows:
<ol><li>Verbal warning</li>
<li>Verbal warning</li>
<li>Day ban</li>
</ol>
Subsequent offenses will result in a day ban, with a review on a case by case basis for possible further punishment.

<p><b>6. Erotic Roleplay Without Consent</b></p>
<p>Erotic roleplay can be defined as any act, described through emote, that has an implied or explicit sexual nature. Erotic roleplay is allowed on New Eden; however, you are expected to adhere to the following rules. Be very careful with whom you attempt to ERP with, as not following the rules can land you a significant ban.
<ul><li>Erotic roleplay may only be performed with an individual that has given consent. This consent may either be implied or stated.
<ul><li>Implied consent: Consent given by continuing the ERP after it has been initiated.
<li>Stated consent: Consent given by receiving a response in LOOC or OOC that it is okay to continue.
</ul>
<li>It is extremely against the rules to ERP with an individual that has not expressed consent.
</ul>
If you attempt to have erotic roleplay with an individual, and they ask you to stop, that is your warning to cease your conduct immediately. If an admin-help is sent, and it is determined that you were already asked to stop, no verbal warning will be given by the administrators. The punishments for ERP without consent is as follows:
<ol><li>Verbal warning (unless you were already warned by other player-party involved)</li>
<li>Week ban</li>
</ol>
Subsequent offenses will almost definitely result in a permanent ban with no chance of appeal, unless the case is very unique.

<p><b>7. No Metagaming</b></p>
<p>Metagaming can be defined as using 3rd party communication, such as IRC network, Skype, Teamspeak, Steam, etc, or even face-to-face, to obtain unfair information about the game. Metagaming is extremely unfair to everyone, and caries with it a severe consequence. Please note, that we understand it is often enjoyable for you to play with your friend/room-mate/spouse/etc, and we do not immediately associate a shared IP address with metagaming. This does not mean you are exempt from this rule, however, and we will still hold you both responsible for any misconduct if you are determined to be breaking this rule. The punishments for metagaming are as follows:
<ol><li>Three day ban</li>
<li>Week ban</li>
</ol>
Subsequent offenses will be reviewed on a case by case basis, but will most likely result in a permanent ban for both parties.

<p><b>8. Job Abuse</b></p>
<p>Job abuse can be defined as occupying an important job position, such as Head of Personnel or Captain, only to neglect all duties that job requires. This can be extremely disruptive to gameplay, and can even ruin the round for many players in certain situations, such as the CE neglecting to set up power. If you plan on fooling around instead of doing your job, consider choosing assistant, or make sure you complete your job duties before leaving your post. Make sure to check back in every once in awhile. Punishments for job abuse are as follows:
<ol><li>Verbal warning</li>
<li>Verbal warning</li>
<li>Job ban</li>
</ol>
Subsequent offenses will result in job bans from all positions deemed important to round progression.

<p><b>9. Server-Destructive Behavior</b></p>
<p>This rule governs the sanctity of New Eden and it's community. It is forbidden to purposefully attempt to slander, defame, corrupt, or destroy the server, be it through words or actions. While this may seem silly, words are a powerful thing, and while the old motto goes "There is no such thing as bad publicity," this is just simply not the case. Here is a list of no-no's in terms of rule 9:
<ul><li>Use a denial-of-service (DoS/DDoS) attack on New Eden, or any of it's staff.</li>
<li>Post scathing reviews of New Eden on social media, such as the Reddit SS13 forum.</li>
<li>Purposefully chase players away, either by words or actions.</li>
<ul><li>An example of this behavior would be insulting a particular player every time they happened to log on.</li>
</ul>
<li>Deface the New Eden forums, whether it be through the use of excessive posting, or otherwise.</li>
<li>Advertise for other servers through New Eden forums, or in-game chat.
<li>Accrue an obscene amount of ban records, enough so that we determine your presence to be permanently unwelcome.</li>
<ul><li>Not an exact amount. Determined based on past offenses. Has only happened a few times in the history of New Eden.</li>
</ul>
<li>Hack the New Eden forums or server (Yes, hacking SS13 is rare but possible.)</li>
<li>Knowingly misrepresent New Eden in a negative light.</li>
<ul><li>Griefing other servers in New Eden's name.
<li>Posing as or impersonating New Eden staff.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
All of these behaviors carry with them a punishment of permanent ban from the server, and some of them are unable to be appealed.

<p><b>10. Mass Grief</b></p>
<p>Mass grief can be generally defined as something that ruins the round for more than just a few people, and can even be round-ending in some circumstances. Some examples of mass grief are as follows:
<ul><li>Purposefully depressurizing rooms with no valid IC reason.</li>
<li>Purposefully releasing viruses onto the station with no valid IC reason.</li>
<li>Purposefully sabatoging the station power with no valid IC reason.</li>
<li>Using the cyborg killswitch with no valid IC reason.</li>
<li>Mass-electrocuting doors with no valid IC reason.</li>
<ul><li>This rule applies to AI. Normal players who do this would be charged with RDM.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
These behaviors are all particularily destructive in their own way, and carry with them serious punishments, which are as follows:
<ol><li>Verbal warning</li>
<li>Day ban OR Job ban</li>
<li>Three day ban OR Job ban</li>
<li>Week ban OR Job ban</li>
</ol>
As always, subsequent offenses will be dealt with on a case by case basis. However, due to the nature of mass grief, it is highly likely that you have already gotten a permanent ban by the fourth offense, due to admin banning discretion.

<p><b>Additional Important Information</b></p>
<p><ul><li>Admins have complete discretion in their actions. The ban lengths listed in this document are only meant to serve as a loose guide, and administrators may interpret the rules however they wish. This does not mean administrators have a free pass to do whatever they want, however, and will be held accountable for all of their actions. It is always important to use screenshots and text logs to document a situation, if you feel an administrator has been unfair to you.</li>
<li>Heads of Staff are accountable for the orders they give. If the Head of Security tells you, a security officer, to execute a prisoner, we will not hold you accountable for following his orders. The Head of Security would be the one in that case to get in trouble. Don't think this is an excuse to stretch his orders and begin killing everyone, however.</li>
<li>Never lie to an administrator. Lying is almost never successful, as admins have access to more tools than the average player knows exists. The only thing you can accomplish by lying is receiving a longer ban time. Don't do it.</li>
